# Baseball Hall of Fame Position Player Comparison

An interactive WebGL graphic showing a single statistic comparison of MLB Hall of Fame Position Players. The statistic chosen for analysis is Wins Above Replacement (WAR). This is not the place for a debate about distilling a HOF player down to a single statistic, just an experiment to visualize this stat.
